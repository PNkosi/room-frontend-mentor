## Summary
The `Hero` function is a React component that displays a hero section with a slideshow of images and corresponding text. It allows the user to navigate between slides using previous and next buttons.

## Example Usage
```javascript
<Hero />
```
The `Hero` component is used to display a hero section on a webpage. It renders a slideshow of images and text, allowing the user to navigate between slides using previous and next buttons.

## Code Analysis
### Inputs
- None
___
### Flow
1. The `Hero` component initializes a reference (`slideRef`) to keep track of the current slide index and a state variable (`currentSlide`) to store the current slide data.
2. The `nextSlide` function is called when the user clicks the next button. It increments the `slideRef` and updates the `currentSlide` state with the next slide data. If the current slide is the last slide, it wraps around to the first slide.
3. The `prevSlide` function is called when the user clicks the previous button. It decrements the `slideRef` and updates the `currentSlide` state with the previous slide data. If the current slide is the first slide, it wraps around to the last slide.
4. The `Hero` component renders the hero section with two sections: one for the image and one for the text.
5. The image section displays the current slide's image using the `Image` component from the `next/image` library. The image is responsive and its dimensions vary based on the screen size.
6. The text section displays the current slide's title, description, and a link to the corresponding page. The title and description are animated using the `motion` component from the `framer-motion` library.
7. The hero section also includes previous and next buttons for navigation. These buttons are displayed at the bottom of the hero section on small screens and at the left side on larger screens.
