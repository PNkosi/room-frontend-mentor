## Summary
This code defines a functional component called `Navbar` that represents a navigation bar. It includes a mobile menu that can be toggled by clicking on a menu icon. The component uses the `useState` hook to manage the state of the mobile menu. It also uses the `Link` component from the `next/link` package to create links to different pages. The mobile menu is animated using the `motion` component from the `framer-motion` package.

<Navbar />
